# Maze Solver

Command-line interface and library for experimenting with grid-based maze solvers (BFS, DFS, bi-BFS, Dijkstra, A*, Greedy, dead-end filling, and agent algorithms).

## Quick Start
To begin, install requirements, then run the app.py file.

### Windows
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Mac
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start
To start, run app.py. Refer to the image below for further instructions.
